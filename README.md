# vercel-ai-playground

Playing around with the new update to the vercel ai sdk, building off their [existing example](https://sdk.vercel.ai/rsc-demo) to find out further capabilities.

Head over to their [GitHub repo](https://github.com/vercel/ai) for the original code and more information.

Also, took a few bits of code from [this repo](https://github.com/RhysSullivan/hogchat/tree/main) for the PostHog processing.
